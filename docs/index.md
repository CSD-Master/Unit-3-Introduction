In this unit our goal is to develop an understanding of what it means to create programs - to tell computers how to accomplish the task that we want them to do for us. We use Code.Org's Game Lab so that we can concentrate on learning *how* to create programs rather than on getting the details of syntax right - that will come in the next units as we start working in Unity and the C# programming language.

There is no shame in starting your programming career learning a block based langage - some of the very best computer science schools in the world start their students off in block based development environments: Carnegie Mellon University uses (and developed) Alice, MIT uses Scratch (which they also developed), and the University of California at Berkeley starts their students off in Snap. But, if you'd like to try your hand at a text based language, in Game Lab clicking on the Show Text button will switch the blocks into JavaScript (and Show Blocks will take you back).

Each of the lessons addresses a "big idea" that will help you create and debug your programs.

  </summary>

  <p><b>Objective:</b> Understand how the <b>sequence</b> of instructions can change the meaning (output) of a program.<p>
  
The first "big idea" is **sequencing** - the order, or sequence, of the **statements** (instructions) in your programs is important. Changing the order the statements in most programs will change the "meaning" of the program - it will do something different.

In these lessons we also start building our debugging skills - learning to:

* read code,
* reason about what it does (or what it is supposed to do),
* develop theories about what is wrong,
* test them,
* repeat until fixed (or you've pulled out all of your hair) - this, by the way, is a loop.

  </summary>

  <p><b>Objectives:</b>
  
    * Recognize parameters to function calls (for example the **x** and **y** in `rect(x, y)` and understand their purpose.
    * Explain the concept of a **variable** and correctly **declare** and use variables in simple cases.
    
  <p>
 
Next up are **parameters** and **variables.**

Parameters are the information needed to do a task - for example, which problems to do for your math homework - or the information that you **pass** to a **method** when you call it. You've already been using parameters to tell the `rect()` and `elipse()` methods where to start drawing and how big the shape should be.

*Variables* are "named values" - you could think of them as labeled jars in which you store a piece of information, a **value.** The label on the jar gives the value a (hopefully) meaningful name. Each variable (jar) holds a single value. You should know how to:
* **Declare** variables.
* **Initialize** variables.
* Name variables (both the rules for "legal" variable names, and how to pick "good" variable names).
* **Assigning** values to variables.
* Reference (use) variables.
